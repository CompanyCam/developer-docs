## Getting an Access Token

The user can generate a new access token in CompanyCam as long as they have sufficient privileges. Users can generate as many access tokens as they wish. The generated access token will be use in the [Authorization header](/#authentication)

> To validate an Access Token, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X POST "https://api.companycam.com/v2/access_tokens/{token}/verify"
```

```json
<%= JSON.pretty_generate({ message: 'Ok' }) %>

<%= JSON.pretty_generate({ message: 'Token not found' }) %>
```
