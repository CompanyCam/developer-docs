# CompanyCam API

CompanyCam helps companies manage field work with smart photos.

If anything is missing or seems incorrect, please check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/CompanyCam/api-docs/issues)
for existing known issues or [create a new issue](https://github.com/CompanyCam/api-docs/issues/new).

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

> Make sure to replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your API key.

CompanyCam expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code> with your personal API key.
